title:  "Convergence Concepts of Random Variables"
---

The concept of convergence is very important but sometimes confusing
when it comes to random variables. There are several types of convergence
regarding a sequence of random variables, e.g., almost surely, convergent in
probability, convergent in distribution, etc.

In this post, I want to give a intuitive explaination and comparison between 
almost sure convergence and convergence in probability.

### Random variables

### Convergence of deterministic sequeces
Recall the definition of the limit of a sequence of real numbers $\\{a_n\\}$. We say that if 
$\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n = a$, for any $\epsilon > 0$, there is a $N_{\epsilon}$ such that 
for every $n > N_{\epsilon}$, $|a_n-a|<\epsilon$.





### Convergence of Random Variables
When it comes to random variables, 

Consider a sequence of random variables $\\{X_n\\}$.
